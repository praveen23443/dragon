This project showcases a simple yet dynamic animation of a dragon moving across the screen using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The dragon glides back and forth smoothly, flipping direction as it reaches the edges of the screen to simulate a flying motion. This project is ideal for beginners learning basic front-end animation techniques, or for anyone looking to add a fun visual effect to a website or game.
